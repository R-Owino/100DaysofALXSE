## Algorithm Complexities

<p>
In computer science, there are multiple ways to solve a problem using different algorithms. It is not enough that the different algorithms can be used to solve a problem. It is required that the method chosen to solve the problem be the most optimal. The method must be:

1. Independent of the machine and the machine's configuration on which the algorithm is running on.
2. Shows a direct correlation with the number of inputs.
3. Can distinguish 2 algorithms clearly without ambiguity.

<p>
There are two such methods that are used:

1. <u>Time complexity</u>
<p>Time complexity refers to the amount of time required by an algorithm to run as a function of the input size. It helps us understand how the algorithm's runtime grows with the increase in input size. Note that the time to run is a function of the length of the input and not the actual execution time of the machine on which the algorithm is running on.</p>

2. <u>Space complexity</u>
<p>Space complexity refers to the amount of memory required by an algorithm to run as a function of the input size. It helps us understand how the algorithm's memory usage grows with the increase in input size.</p>
