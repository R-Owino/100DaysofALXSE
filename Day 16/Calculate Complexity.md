## How to calculate complexity

<p>LIke I'd said earlier while introducing complexities, there are two aspects of an algorithm that are most important in computer science: the time it takes to run the algorithm and the space it takes in the memory.</p>

<p>
There are 3 different notations used to represent complexites:

1. <u>Big-O notation</u>
<p>This is the behaviour of an algorithm in the worst case</p>

2. <u>Big-Ω notation</u>
<p>This is the behaviour of an algorithm in the best case</p>

3. <u>Big-Θ notation</u>
<p>This is the behaviour of an algorithm in the average case</p>

</p>

### Big-O notation
<p>This is where the main focus lies because it represents the maximum number of steps taken by an algorithm to solve a problem.</p>

<p>Time and space complexities of an algorithm are calculated by counting the number of statements the program has to execute.</p>

<p>
Let's see the common complexities and how they work:

1. <u>Linear complexity</u>
<p>In linear complexity, time/space taken grows linearly with the increase in the number of inputs. For example, an input of 1, the time and space complexity would be 1 i.e O(1)=1, O(2)=2, ... O(N)=N

2. <u>Quadratic complexity</u>

3. <u>Constant complexity</u>
4. <u>Exponential complexity</u>
5. <u>Logarithmic complexity</u>
