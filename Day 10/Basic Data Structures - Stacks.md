<p>Over the past few days I have comprehensively covered linked lists data structures. Today, I will look into stacks ðŸ“š</p>

## 3. Stacks
<p>In Day 4 I went over arrays and linked lists over the past few days. One of the main benefits of arrays and linked lists are their ability to be used to define other data structures.</p>

<p>Stacks are linear data structures that follow a Last In First Out (LIFO) or First In Last Out (FILO) principle and allows insertion and deletion operations from the top. Implementation of the stack can be done by contiguous memory which is an array, and non-contiguous memory which is a linked list. Examples of stacks include a pile of books, a stack of plates, a deck of cards etc</p>

    <figcaption align="center">Stack of books</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The following terms are regularly used with stacks. These also double up as the operations done on a stack.</p>
<ol>
    <li>Top - the last element to be inserted to the stack</li>
    <li>Push - inserting a new elemnet in the stack</li>
    <li>Pop - removing or deleting elements from the stack</li>
    <li>Peek - retrieve the topmost element without removing it from the collection</li>
</ol>

<p>The implementation for these will be don in the subsequent <i>.py</i> files.</p>
