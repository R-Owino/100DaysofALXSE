## Introduction to Data Structures and Algorithms

### Data Structures
- Simply put: data structures define how data can be stored in different forms; a way to store data.
- Data is structured in different ways depending on what data is available and wha is to be done with it.
- Example: if we want to store data about a chain of consequences, we use an if-then structure. We choose this structure because we start from the beginning of an action and map out all the possible "then" scenarios. With this structure, it is easy to see how different choices can lead to different paths.
- Data structures are essential in creating fast and powerful algorithms as they help in organizing and managing data, reduce complexity and increase efficiency


### Algorithms
- Simply put: algorithms helps us solve different problems, often by searching thru and manipulating data structures.
-  Algorithms are a step-by-step procedure to solve a given problem.
- Example: directions on how to get somewhere is an algorithm. One person might have a set of direction instructions and another a different set of instructions. At the end of the day, the person being directed should get to their destination, preferably using the shortest route.
- In computing, algorithms are a step-by-step instructions written in a programming language, and instead of using landmarks, they use data structures.
- An efficient algorithm helps to find a solution and can transform a slow program into a fast one.
- Examples of algorithms include:
    - Finding the fastest route in a GPS navigation system
    - Navigating an airplane or a car (cruise control)
    - Finding what users search for (search engine)
    - Sorting, for example sorting movies by rating


### Why are they needed?
- Data Structures and Algorithms(DSA) is about finding efficient ways to store and retrieve data, perform operations on data and solve specific problems.
- DSA helps in memory and computational resources effctively. Poorly stored data and poorly written instructions can lead to excess resources being utilized and poor performance.
- DSA is vital in enabling scalability and flexibility in software development. Scalable data structures can handle larger data and increased user loads without derailing performance.

### Applications of DSA
- Manage large amounts of data, such as in a social network or search engine
- Schedule tasks; decide which task a computer should do first
- Planning routes, as in a GPS system
- Optimizing resources, such as arranging tasks so they can be completed as fast as possible
- Solving complex problems such as making a computer learn from data
