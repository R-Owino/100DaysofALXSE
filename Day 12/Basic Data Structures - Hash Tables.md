<p>This is the last of basic data structures. Over the next few days, I will be learning more about hash tables, also called hash maps</p>

## 5. Hash maps/tables
<p>Hash tables are specialized data structures that allow fast access to data based on a key - data is stored in an associative manner. Essentially, a hash table works by taking a key input, and then computes an index into an array in which the desired value can be found. It uses a hash function to calculate this index. The process of mapping the keys to appropriate locations (or indices) in a hash table is called <i>hashing</i>.</p>
