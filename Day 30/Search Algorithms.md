## Search Algorithms

### What are search algorithms?
<p>
In Computer Science, a search algorithm is a technique for finding a specific item or group of items among a collection of data. Basically, they are developed to solve search problems.
Search algorithms work to retrieve information stored within a particular data structure, or calculated in the search space of a problem domain, with either discrete or continuous values.
Search algorithms operate by checking each element in the dataset in order to locate the target selection. 
</p>

### Terminologies used with search algorthims
1. Target element
<p>
Specific element or group of elements that is being looked for within the data collection. The target could be a value, a record, a key or something else.
</p>

2. Search space
<p>
The entire collection of data where the target element is being looked for. It varies in size and organization depending on the data structure used.
</p>

3. Complexity
<p>
Measured in terms of time and space requirements, searching has different levels of complexity depending on the data structure and algorithm used.
</p>

3. Deterministic vs non-deterministic
<p>
Binary search algorthms are deterministic i.e they follow a clear systematic approach.
Linear search algorithms are non-deterministic i.e they need to examine the entire search space in the worst case.
</p>

### Types of search algorithms

1. Linear Search
<p>
Also called sequential search, it starts from one end and goes through the entire list until the target element is found, else it goes through to the end of the list.

It works on both sorted and unsorted lists, and does not need any preconditioned list for the operation. However, its efficiency is lesser as compared to other search algorithms since it checks all elements one by one.

Time complexity for linear search is O(n) on the worst and average cases and O(1) on the best case.
</p>

2. Sentinel Linear Search
<p>
Just like linear search, sentinel search is an algorithm for a list of items stored in a sequential manner.

<details>
  <summary><strong>Recap ðŸ”„</strong></summary>

  - Linear search works by going through each item of the list in a linear fashion, comparing it to the target. This results to either finding the required item or not.

  - It does this by making two comparisons in every iteration
        - First iteration: check if the we're at the end of the list
        - Second iteration: check if current item matches the target or not
</details>

Linear search does comparisons twice. What if there was a way to make the search faster? This is where sentinel search comes in.

Sentinel search works by first inserting the target element at the end of the list, then comparisons are done with each item of the list until the required item is found. In this case, either the required item is in the list, in which case it will be found before we reach the end of the list. Or the list didnâ€™t have the target, so the algorithm will reach the end of the list and find the target item that we have inserted.

This way, we only need to check if the item matches the target, not if the list is empty. This is because one way or another, we'll find the target and break out of the loop.

Lastly, we check if the item found was already there or manually added. This check will happen only once and the entire runtime of the algorithm will be cut down significantly because we have one less comparison to do in every iteration of the loop.

The time complexity of sentinel search is O(n) in the worst case and O(1) in the best case, when the key is found in the first iteration.

3. Binary Search
<p>
Binary search algorithm follows the divide and conquer strategy to find an element. It works on a sorted array by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half. The idea of binary search is to use the information that the array is sorted and reduce the time complexity to O(log N).

It works perfectly under the following conditions:
- The data structure must be sorted.
- Access to any element of the data structure takes constant time.

This is how it operates:
- Initially, the search space is the entire array and the target is compared with the middle element of the array.
- If they are not equal, the half in which the target cannot lie is eliminated and the search continues on the remaining half, again taking the middle element to compare to the target, and repeating this until the target is found.
- If the search ends with the remaining half being empty, the target is not in the array.
</p>

4. Ternary binary search
<p>
A binary search algorithm, but instead of dividing the list into 2 parts, the list is divided into 3 parts - we now have 2 mid points. This also means it is a divide and conquer algorithm. The mid points are used to determine which part the target element is because at each iteration, the algorithm ignores â…“ of the list and proceeds to search in the remaining â…”.

The time complexity of ternary search is O(log<sub>3</sub>n).

The operations is just the same as in normal binary search, only that instead of dividing into 2 parts, it divides the array into 3 parts.

Also, like in binary search, the list must be sorted first before searching an element, and searching for an element that is duplicated returns the position of the first occurance of that element.
</p>

4. Depth-first search
<p>
Used more intricately in data structures like trees and graphs. It explores the depth of a branch before breadth.
</p>

5. Breadth-first search
<p>
Also used in tree and graph data structures. It explores all the neighboring nodes before proceeding to the nodes at the next level depth.
