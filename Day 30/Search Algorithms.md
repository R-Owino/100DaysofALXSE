## Search Algorithms

### What are search algorithms?
<p>
In Computer Science, a search algorithm is a technique for finding a specific item or group of items among a collection of data. Basically, they are developed to solve search problems.
Search algorithms work to retrieve information stored within a particular data structure, or calculated in the search space of a problem domain, with either discrete or continuous values.
Search algorithms operate by checking each element in the dataset in order to locate the target selection.

### Terminologies used with search algorthims
1. Target element
<p>
Specific element or group of elements that is being looked for within the data collection. The target could be a value, a record, a key or something else.
</p>

2. Search space
<p>
The entire collection of data where the target element is being looked for. It varies in size and organization depending on the data structure used.
</p>

3. Complexity
<p>
Measured in terms of time and space requirements, searching has different levels of complexity depending on the data structure and algorithm used.
</p>

3. Deterministic vs non-deterministic
<p>
Binary search algorthms are deterministic i.e they follow a clear systematic approach.
Linear search algorithms are non-deterministic i.e they need to examine the entire search space in the worst case.
</p>

### Types of search algorithms
<p>
There are 4 primary search algorithms. The last two will be covered indepth when I get to Tree Data Structures
</p>

1. Linear Search
<p>
Also called sequential search, it starts from one end and goes through the entire list until the target element is found, else it goes through to the end of the list.
It works on both sorted and unsorted lists, and does not need any preconditioned list for the operation. However, its efficiency is lesser as compared to other search algorithms since it checks all elements one by one.
</p>

2. Binary Search

3. Depth-first search
<p>
Used more intricately in data structures like trees and graphs. It explores the depth of a branch before breadth.
</p>

4. Breadth-first search
<p>
Also used in tree and graph data structures. It explores all the neighboring nodes before proceeding to the nodes at the next level depth.
